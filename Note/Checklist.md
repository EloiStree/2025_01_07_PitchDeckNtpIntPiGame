  - Add Static Int Lobby Bridge with Broadcaster
    - https://github.com/EloiStree/2025_03_18_IntLobbySampleSpaceship.git 
- Demo 
  - Add SpaceShip Sample
    - Game Lobby Prefab for XR
    - Monitor Lobby Prefab for the Phone


- I need to know when a blob die or spawn
- I need to know (if not my code ) what is the pourcent state of game
- I need to know when the code is enter
- We need to know how to relaod the scene (reset or scenemanager ?) 
  

Game to Facade GF
Facade to Game FG
- Check List to link
- How do we
  - Link the monster death and spawn

- When Move trigger code to save relocation
- Add button to force "Find and reload"


---------

R&D: 
- Use image in the Van to reset code ?

============

What I had in mind
- A game is launch every 5 minutes
- Player wait in lobby for next game
- The same game happen to everyone
- The goal is to understand what happened
- Mini game are playble offline

Technicality added 
- some interaciton are possible with IID
  - One is death game is lost 
- Asked: game can be relaunch ( offseted)

Note of future project: 
- Make a websocket server on the pi that allows to share screenshot of current camera feed for monitoring
